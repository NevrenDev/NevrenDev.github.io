Akari woke up from her dream, wondering why she saw herself in a strange world. It looked the same as hers, but something was odd... some people were flying and some had strange parts all over their body. After a few minutes of staring at a wall she shrugged off the dream, like usual and went to the bathroom to dress up and prepare for the day.
Soon after Akari took her schoolbag and put on her shoes.
"I'm going to school!" She said loudly to inform her parents about her departure. As soon as Akari opened the door, a cozy wind brushed her cheeks and warm sunlight illuminated her blue eyes.
"What a nice day" she said to herself before going off.

Akari grabbed her bike and headed to school, not aware that she wouldn't make it there. After taking the last turn before arriving, some random truck lost control and drove straight into her ending her journey in this world...

Suddenly Akari opened her eyes with a gasp. Sharp pain from the hit pulsating through her body, but it disappeared quickly. As she raised her head she noticed something odd. *Was this a dream?* she thought as she took a look at the place where she was. It was a bedroom, but not hers. It was filthy as no one cleaned it in a while. She left the bed, it was old and looked like it would fall apart soon. Akari took a deeper look at her surroundings noticing something different through the windows. She wasn't in her town, and soon she realised it wasn't her world either as soon as someone flew above the village she was in.
